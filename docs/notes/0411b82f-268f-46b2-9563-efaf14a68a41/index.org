#+TITLE: SAN: Master Plan

* The big goal

The big goal is to democratize architecture the way maker spaces have
democratized industrial design.  And of course we’re not creating
static buildings of the last millennium.  We’re inviting the buildings
themselves to partake in their construction.

* The role of SAN

The [[https://github.com/feklee/san][Self Aware Network]] (SAN) is an intermediate step.  Individuals
join a collaborative construction process.  The network gives visual
and auditory feedback concerning how it perceives its construction and
its integration with the environment.
