#+TITLE: SAN: Master Plan

* The big goal

The big goal is to democratize architecture the way maker spaces have
democratized industrial design.  And of course we’re not creating
static buildings of the last millennium.  We’re inviting the buildings
themselves to partake in their construction.

* The role of SAN

The [[https://github.com/feklee/san][Self Aware Network]] (SAN) is an intermediate step.  Individuals
join a collaborative construction process.  The network gives visual
and auditory feedback concerning how it perceives its construction and
its integration with the environment.

* Beyond SAN

- Organic buildings: Just as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Grown][chairs]] out of trees or objects out of
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecovative_Design][mushrooms]] – houses could be grown.  Such buildings are literally
  partaking in their construction.  A start would be models grown over
  the course or a few weeks or months.

- Sustainability and robotics: Robots may be able to construct
  individualized buildings from scrap found on the “ground” in way
  more sophisticated ways than humans.  Furthermore, buildings can be
  reconfigured continuously, preventing waste of material and offering
  endless possibility for play and experimentation.
