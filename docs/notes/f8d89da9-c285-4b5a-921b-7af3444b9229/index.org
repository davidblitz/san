#+TITLE: SAN: Apps

* Introduction

The /Self Aware Network/ (SAN) is a kit for assembling architectural
structures that are aware of themselves.

A structure is comprised of a network.  Nodes communicate and send
information to a computer, which is then able to understand what has
been built.

This information can be used for various purposes:

- visualization of the structure

- modular sound synthesis (see the document [[https://feklee.github.io/san/notes/a55d9218-9ada-45ad-aa93-6b43d94b676d/][SAN: Audio]])

- apps

* App ideas

** Chemistry

An app can give instructions about what to build, and it can give
feedback about what has been built.  Possibly nodes in the network
change color to match atom types.

** Pacman

Gena Shabanov, a software developer suggested at Science Hack Lab
Berlin on June 8 2019 to create a Pacman like game.  A character moves
through the structure, and one needs to adapt it to achieve certain
goals in the game.

There is a problem, though.  As of June 2019, changes to the structure
are not communicated quickly enough to the computer.  So a real-time
action game cannot be implemented.  However, it may be possible to
create a game where one builds a structure, and then something
happens.  For inspiration see for example the game series [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Machine_(series)][The
Incredible Machine]].
