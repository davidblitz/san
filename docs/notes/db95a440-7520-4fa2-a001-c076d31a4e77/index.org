#+TITLE: SAN: PCB Design

* Objectives

- Find dimensions of PCBs that can then be used with KiCad.

- Check the schematic designed with KiCad.

- Create a manufacturing ready board layout.

- Optimize price and manufacturing time.


* 3D mockup

Via the top left menu, layers can be turned off to reveal the inside
of the sphere.  Only certain large components are part of the mockup.
The 3D mockup has been created with the [[https://mcneel.github.io/Iris/][Iris plugin]] from the Rhino 3D
model file [[./mockup.3dm][mockup.3dm]].

- The diameter of the sphere is 50 mm.

- Only larger components have been included.

- There are two PCBs in order to get the LEDs in the correct
  positions.

- The right angle SMD LEDs shine light sidewards.  They are mounted at
  an offset from the shell in order to diffuse light.

- The top USB connector is abused for interfacing with an FTDI.  This
  is to easily be able to update the firmware.

This is a snapshot of the schematic.  Only one of the NeoPixel
circuits is shown.  They are all the same except for the component
references.

The most recent version of the schematic can be found in the KiCad
project [[https://github.com/feklee/san/tree/master/nodes/pcb/node][node]] in the SAN repo on GitHub.

** OPL
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: seeed-opl
:END:

Seeed keeps components in stock for quick production time. These are
listed in the [[https://www.seeedstudio.com/opl.html][Open Part Library]]. Notes:

- The OPL is split into two libraries: Selected can be the /Seeed OPL/
  or the /Shenzhen OPL/, which is based on a [[https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2018/12/04/just-what-you-wanted-for-xmas-introducing-the-new-shenzhen-open-parts-library-with-over-10000-parts/][partnership]] with the
  HuaQiang Group.

- For the /Seeed OPL/ there is a corresponding [[https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OPL_Kicad_Library][KiCad library]]
  available.

- For the project, only components from the OPL will be used. (Let’s
  hope components in the Seeed OPL are in stock.)

|   4 | Shenzhen | 0533980271           | 2 pin PicoBlade connector | Molex        |

Only one of the FFC connectors is needed, of course. If the
accelerometer circuit fits on the top board, then only six pins are
needed.

* NeoPixel LEDs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: led
:END:

The LEDs have been changed to point upwards instead of sidewards. The
workaround is to design the 3D printed shell so that light is
deflected sidewards, possibly with the help of a reflective patch.

Concerning connecting the LEDs, see the Adafruit NeoPixel LED
[[https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/basic-connections][Überguide]]. It mentions:

- “When using a DC power supply, or an especially large battery, we
  recommend adding a large capacitor (1000 µF, 6.3V or higher) across
  the + and terminals.”

  With the board here, this may not be necessary. After all, the
  NeoPixels are powered by regulated 5V. (to keep brightness constant)

- “With through-hole NeoPixels (5mm or 8mm), add a 0.1 µF capacitor
  between the + and pins of EACH PIXEL. Individual pixels may
  misbehave without this “decoupling cap.”

- “Adding a ~470 ohm resistor between your microcontroller's data pin
  and the data input on the NeoPixels can help prevent spikes on the
  data line that can damage your first pixel.”

There is also a [[https://statics3.seeedstudio.com/images/opl/datasheet/304990003.pdf][datasheet]].


* Accelerometer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: accelerometer
:END:

First: The accelerometer circuit can be left away entirely, if that
makes things easier. It is an experimental feature, and the system
will function without it.

Requirements:

- analog readout (because there are no free timers, and because
  readout should be as fast as possible)

- one axis (direction doesn’t matter)

- range as close as possible to ±1g, definitely no more than ±3g

No compatible accelerometers are available in the Seeed
[[#seeed-opl][OPL]]. Workaround:

- leave the space vacant

- in order to make hand soldering as easy as possible:

  + choose the ADXL335, which is larger than the ADXL337

  + make the pads large

It may be possible to find someone in Hong Kong or Shenzhen to hand
solder these.


* Open questions

- /Is there a better way to connect the PCBs?/

  An eight wire FCC is used.  Nicer would be a solution without FCC,
  where the boards can simply be plugged together, and done.

  See also the thread [[https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/466727][Platinen über Kreuz kontaktieren]] (German) in the
  forum on Microcontroller.net.

- /Use plated-trough holes as cheap and simple alternative to the
  Molex 0533980271 [[https://www.molex.com/product/picoblade.html][PicoBlade]] connectors?/

  The PicoBlade connectors are for connecting the BNC connectors.
  Without plated-trough holes, the cables would be manually soldered
  to the PCBs, for example by participants during a workshop.

- /Should there be a diode in front of the 5 V regulator?/

  For comparison: The Arduino Uno has an M7 diode right after =PWRIN=.
  The Arduino Pro Mini doesn’t have a diode to protect agains reverse
  polarity.  Still – from experience – reversing polarity doesn’t
  damage the board.

- /Add holes for regular through hole NeoPixel LEDs?/

  This is for the case the WS2811-SMD-LED circuits turn out not to
  work.  There won’t be enough time to do a second production run.

  Solder bridges could be used to have the easy option to disconnect
  nonfunctional SMD NeoPixel circuits.

- /Add a solder bridge to easily turn off the accelerometer circuit?/

  Then the circuit can be easily disconnected in case it doesn’t work.

- /Do the selected LEDs have a circular uniform viewing angle?/

- /Should the top PCB get more space?/

  It could be extended downwards at the expense of the bottom PCB.

- /Move the accelerometer circuit to the top PCB?/

  That way the FCC would require only six instead of eight wires.
  However, there may not be enough space for the circuit in the top
  PCB.
