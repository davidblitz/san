#+TITLE: SAN: PCB Design

* Objectives

- Find dimensions of PCBs that can then be used with KiCad.

- Check the schematic designed with KiCad.

- Create a manufacturing ready board layout.

- Optimize price and manufacturing time.


* 3D mockup

Via the top left menu, layers can be turned off to reveal the inside
of the sphere.  Only certain large components are part of the mockup.
The 3D mockup has been created with the [[https://mcneel.github.io/Iris/][Iris plugin]] from the Rhino 3D
model file [[./mockup.3dm][mockup.3dm]].

- The diameter of the sphere is 50 mm.

- Only larger components have been included.

- There are two PCBs in order to get the LEDs in the correct
  positions.

- The right angle SMD LEDs shine light sidewards.  They are mounted at
  an offset from the shell in order to diffuse light.

- The top USB connector is abused for interfacing with an FTDI.  This
  is to easily be able to update the firmware.

This is a snapshot of the schematic.  The most recent version of the

** OPL
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: seeed-opl
:END:

Seeed keeps components in stock for quick production time. These are
listed in the [[https://www.seeedstudio.com/opl.html][Open Part Library]]. Notes:

- The OPL is split into two libraries: Selected can be the /Seeed OPL/
  or the /Shenzhen OPL/, which is based on a [[https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2018/12/04/just-what-you-wanted-for-xmas-introducing-the-new-shenzhen-open-parts-library-with-over-10000-parts/][partnership]] with the
  HuaQiang Group.

- For the /Seeed OPL/ there is a corresponding [[https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OPL_Kicad_Library][KiCad library]]
  available.

- For the project, only components from the OPL will be used. (Let’s
  hope components in the Seeed OPL are in stock.)

|   4 | Shenzhen | 0533980271           | 2 pin PicoBlade connector | Molex        |

Only one of the FFC connectors is needed, of course. If the
accelerometer circuit fits on the top board, then only six pins are
needed.

* NeoPixel LEDs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: led
:END:

The LEDs have been changed to point upwards instead of sidewards. The
workaround is to design the 3D printed shell so that light is
deflected sidewards, possibly with the help of a reflective patch.

Concerning connecting the LEDs, see the Adafruit NeoPixel LED
[[https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/basic-connections][Überguide]]. It mentions:

- “When using a DC power supply, or an especially large battery, we
  recommend adding a large capacitor (1000 µF, 6.3V or higher) across
  the + and terminals.”

  With the board here, this may not be necessary. After all, the
  NeoPixels are powered by regulated 5V. (to keep brightness constant)

- “With through-hole NeoPixels (5mm or 8mm), add a 0.1 µF capacitor
  between the + and pins of EACH PIXEL. Individual pixels may
  misbehave without this “decoupling cap.”

- “Adding a ~470 ohm resistor between your microcontroller's data pin
  and the data input on the NeoPixels can help prevent spikes on the
  data line that can damage your first pixel.”

There is also a [[https://statics3.seeedstudio.com/images/opl/datasheet/304990003.pdf][datasheet]].


* Accelerometer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: accelerometer
:END:

First: The accelerometer circuit can be left away entirely, if that
makes things easier. It is an experimental feature, and the system
will function without it.

Requirements:

- analog readout (because there are no free timers, and because
  readout should be as fast as possible)

- one axis (direction doesn’t matter)

- range as close as possible to ±1g, definitely no more than ±3g

No compatible accelerometers are available in the Seeed
[[#seeed-opl][OPL]]. Workaround:

- leave the space vacant

- in order to make hand soldering as easy as possible:

  + choose the ADXL335, which is larger than the ADXL337

  + make the pads large

It may be possible to find someone in Hong Kong or Shenzhen to hand
solder these.


* Pre-production checklist
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pre-tests
:END:

- Do the FCC connectors match? (mirrored)

- Are the holes big enough for the 5 mm NeoPixel pins?

- Are there unanswered [[#questions][open questions]]?

- Are there components / connectors colliding mechanically with the
  sphere or the other board?

- Is the FTDI interface wired up correctly?

- Is the bootloader burner interface wired up correctly?

- Does the tag-connect have sufficient space?

- Are all ground zones connected?

- Within Seeed [[http://support.seeedstudio.com/knowledgebase/articles/447362-fusion-pcb-specification][Fusion PCB specification]]?

- DRC OK?

- What is unconnected in DRC?


* Open questions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: questions
:END:

- /Should there be 470 Ω resistors between BNC connectors and the 328P
  pins?/

  The idea is to protect the 328P when someone accidentally shorts a
  BNC connector. On the other hand, there are no such resistors in the
  current hand-soldered version, and things work fine (asides from the
  NeoPixel LEDs starting to fail more frequently).
