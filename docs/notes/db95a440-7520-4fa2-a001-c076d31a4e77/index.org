#+TITLE: SAN: PCB Design

* Objectives

- Find dimensions of PCBs that can then be used with KiCad.

- Check the schematic designed with KiCad.

- Create a manufacturing ready board layout.

- Optimize price and manufacturing time.


* 3D mockup

Via the top left menu, layers can be turned off to reveal the inside
of the sphere.  Only certain large components are part of the mockup.
The 3D mockup has been created with the [[https://mcneel.github.io/Iris/][Iris plugin]] from the Rhino 3D
model file [[./mockup.3dm][mockup.3dm]].

- The diameter of the sphere is 50 mm.

- Only larger components have been included.

- There are two PCBs in order to get the LEDs in the correct
  positions.

- The top USB connector is abused for interfacing with an FTDI.  This
  is to easily be able to update the firmware.

This is a snapshot of the schematic.  The most recent version of the
schematic can be found in the KiCad project [[https://github.com/feklee/san/tree/master/nodes/pcb/node][node]] in the SAN repo on
GitHub.

** OPL
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: seeed-opl
:END:

Seeed keeps components in stock for quick production time. These are
listed in the [[https://www.seeedstudio.com/opl.html][Open Part Library]]. Notes:

- The OPL is split into two libraries: Selected can be the /Seeed OPL/
  or the /Shenzhen OPL/, which is based on a [[https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2018/12/04/just-what-you-wanted-for-xmas-introducing-the-new-shenzhen-open-parts-library-with-over-10000-parts/][partnership]] with the
  HuaQiang Group.

- For the /Seeed OPL/ there is a corresponding [[https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OPL_Kicad_Library][KiCad library]]
  available.

- For the project, only components from the OPL will be used. (Let’s
  hope components in the Seeed OPL are in stock.)

* Ideas
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ideas
:END:

- Replace the Mini USB Type B connector with a Tag-Connect interface,
  sticking out of the shell behind the battery.

  Then it may be possible to make both boards the same size.

- Replace NeoPixel THT LEDs with SMD LEDs shining sidewards.

- Use a separate MCU for controlling the LEDs. This takes off load
  from the main MCU, allowing the LED colors to be changed without
  taking away too many clock cycles otherwise needed for communication
  between nodes. Also a separate MCU may have enough ports to drive
  the LEDs directly.

- Move the Tag-Connect interface for burning the bootloader to the
  back. This saves space on the front.
