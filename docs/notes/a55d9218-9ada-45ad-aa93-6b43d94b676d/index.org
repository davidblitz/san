#+TITLE: SAN: Audio

* Introduction

SAN is a construction system for architectural structures that
interact with the environment visually and auditory.  This document
discusses the auditory part: /How can an architectural structure be a
musical instrument?/

* Approaches

What follows is a discussion of vairous approaches to turning the
structure into sound or even have it generate music.


** Sound of molecular vibrations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sound
:END:

*** Idea

/Treat the structure as a molecule made up of carbon atoms.  Turn
molecular vibrations into a sound./

Like the spherical building elements of SAN, carbon atoms have four
bonds arranged in tetrahedral symmetry.  Molecules can be made to
vibrate.  These [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_vibration][molecular vibrations]] have different frequencies which
together make up a spectrum:

*** Examples

Scientists and musicians have explored turning molecular spectra into
sound:

  different molecule and its sound:

*** Calculation of vibrations

There are many ways to calculate molecular vibrations.  Simple
estimates can be done on a piece of paper.  Relatively accurate
results are given by the /harmonic approximation/ where the bonds
between atoms are treated as harmonic oscillators (see the book
[[https://books.google.de/books?id=CPkvsDrPiv0C&pg=PA150&dq=048663941X&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi36qaskqrhAhXNwosKHVv-CdYQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=false][Molecular Vibrations]] by Wilson, Decius, and Cross, 1955).  Then there
are quantum mechanical methods that are ever more accurate and
complex.

To get an idea concerning how different spectra look, the software
Gaussian 09 can be used:

** Collaborative modular synthesizer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: modular-synth
:END:

*** Idea

Each node is module in a big modular synthesizer:

- Using a web UI, users can tweak the properties of individual
  modules.

- Reconnecting nodes updates how the modular synthesizer is
  patched. (of course)

*** A module

Each node has several child nodes and one parent node.

Inputs:

- outputs from the neighboring child nodes

- position of the node in space: x, y, z

- color of node

Output:

- parent node

There could be various predefined properties, such as pitch or the
duration of a repeating loop, that the user can attach inputs to.
Also the node could be made freely programmable, perhaps globally for
all nodes at once.

The UI for a node could be a webapp compatible with smartphones.


*** Master output:

There is one root node in the network, which is where the structure is
connected to the computer.  This root node serves as the master
output.

** Sequencer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sequencer
:END:

Idea: /Walk through the molecule, atom by node. Trigger an action at
each step, such as playing a note associated with node./

Open question: Is there a standard way to walk the atoms of a
molecule?


** Adjacency matrix
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: matrix
:END:

The adjaceny matrix is visible in the main interface.  Create sound
based on that.


** Neurons

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: neurons
:END:

Treat SAN as a neural network.  Investigate how pulses are passed
around in a biological neural network.
