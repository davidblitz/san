#+TITLE: SAN: Audio

* Introduction

SAN is a construction system for architectural structures that
interact with the environment visually and auditory.  This document
discusses the auditory part: /How can an architectural structure be a
musical instrument?/

* Approaches

What follows is a discussion of vairous approaches to turning the
structure into sound or even have it generate music.


** Sound of molecular vibrations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sound
:END:

*** Idea

/Treat the structure as a molecule made up of carbon atoms.  Turn
molecular vibrations into a sound./

Like the spherical building elements of SAN, carbon atoms have four
bonds arranged in tetrahedral symmetry.  Molecules can be made to
vibrate.  These [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_vibration][molecular vibrations]] have different frequencies which
together make up a spectrum:

*** Examples

Scientists and musicians have explored turning molecular spectra into
sound:

  different molecule and its sound:

  ½ spin systems: An overview]] at ZKM Karlsruhe.

*** Calculation of vibrations

There are many ways to calculate molecular vibrations.  Simple
estimates can be done on a piece of paper.  Relatively accurate
results are given by the /harmonic approximation/ where the bonds
between atoms are treated as harmonic oscillators (see the book
[[https://books.google.de/books?id=CPkvsDrPiv0C&pg=PA150&dq=048663941X&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi36qaskqrhAhXNwosKHVv-CdYQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=false][Molecular Vibrations]] by Wilson, Decius, and Cross, 1955).  Then there
are quantum mechanical methods that are ever more accurate and
complex.

To get an idea concerning how different spectra look, the software
Gaussian 09 can be used:

** Collaborative modular synthesizer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: modular-synth
:END:

*** Idea

Each node is module in a big modular synthesizer:

- Using a web UI, users can tweak the properties of individual
  modules.

- Reconnecting nodes updates how the modular synthesizer is patched.

- Master output: There is one root node in the network, which is where
  the structure is connected to the computer.  This root node serves
  as the master output.

*** A module

Each node has several child nodes and one parent node.  By default
each node acts as an oscillator possibly at a base frequency detuned
depending on the node’s position.  All oscillators are simply added.
This makes the structure make sound by default without any user
interaction.

- Inputs: child nodes

- Outputs: parent nodes, or root node (master)

#+CAPTION: Screenshot of a module connected to master, July 23 2019

*** Possible extensions

It could be interesting to give the user a selection of inputs:

- outputs from the neighboring child nodes

- oscillator

- position of the node in space: x, y, z

- color of node

There could be various predefined properties, such as pitch or the
duration of a repeating loop, that the user can attach inputs to.
Also the node could be made freely programmable, perhaps globally for
all nodes at once.

In addition to the sliders, users could be given the option to tap on
number and modify it using text entry.

** Sequencer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sequencer
:END:

Idea: /Walk through the molecule, atom by node.  Trigger an action at
each step, such as playing a note associated with node./

Open question: Is there a standard way to walk the atoms of a
molecule?


** Adjacency matrix
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: matrix
:END:

The adjaceny matrix is visible in the main interface.  Create sound
based on that.


** Neurons

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: neurons
:END:

Treat SAN as a neural network.  Investigate how pulses are passed
around in a biological neural network.

(idea of Brian / Sonic Code Sessions 02/2019)

** Mood

Ivan Palmegiani pointed out that Science Hack Lab Berlin on June 8
2019 that there is research that certain sound waves affect mood.

This means that mood can be changed according to the structure built.

** Cognimates extension

Stafania suggested on June 17 CEST at Betahaus in Berlin to create an
extension for SAN for her [[http://cognimates.me][Cognimates]] AI teaching platform.  She
outlined that it may be possible to train the AI to create music based
on certain constellations.
