#+TITLE: Abstract

Random bits and pieces, required to be sorted and combined:

- The Self Aware Network (SAN) is an experiment about the future of
  architecture.  It is comprised of a system for building intelligent
  structures that /interact/ and /communicate/ with the environment.

- Eventually structures will acquire artificial intelligence (AI),
  thereby being able to /understand/ the environment.  The next step
  then is for structures to become robotic.  This allows them to
  /adapt/ to the environment.  The vision is for architecture to
  become fluid, to constantly reconfigure itself and to follow the
  needs of the people.

- This sculpture is represented by a /network of nodes./

- The network is aware of itself, the way we are aware of our body.
  How the network sees itself is visualized and projected (on the wall
  or the floor).

- The network understands its environment.  It has senses (gravity
  sensors).

- Visitors can reconfigure the network to make it adapt to its
  environment.

- In hands-on workshops, visitors collaboratively erect the network
  step by step.  We solder electronics and build assemble the
  individual elements, then we connect them.

- The network communicates with its environment, visually and
  auditory.

- The network forms a modular synthesizer.  Visitors can connect to
  network nodes and adjust their audio properties.  They can listen to
  the network via speakers or headphones.

- Nodes have tetrahedral geometry.  This is known as SPÂ³ hybridization
  in Chemistry.  This geometry underlies the hardest known structure
  in nature, that of diamond.

- Edges have uniform length.

- Material: stainless steel, electronics, light
