General rule according to the [[https://podio.com/webforms/22057498/1544767][application form]]: “The application

** Title (15 words maximum)

- Rules: “Title and a short slogan describing the project”

- Proposal: /The Self Aware Network, a geodesic sound sculpture that interacts with visitors and the environment/


** Abstract (200 words maximum)

- Rules:

  + “A short abstract describing the main idea behind the installation
    and its relation with the ‘Eyes of the City’ theme.  The abstract
    should explain how spatial features could contribute in fostering
    debate on the topics expressed in the curatorial statement and how
    the piece attempts to answer the theme’s main questions.”

  + The abstract can be entered into the application form.

  + The application form is missing a field for a title.  So it seems
    best to add the title to the abstract.
