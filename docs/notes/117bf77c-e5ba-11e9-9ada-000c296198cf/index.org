#+TITLE: SAN: Coco Nodes & Bamboo Edges

* Introduction

The /Self Aware Network/ (SAN) is a kit for assembling architectural structures
that are aware of themselves.  A structure is comprised of a network.  Nodes
communicate and send information to the brain, a computer which is able to
understand what has been built.  Structures communicate with the environment
visually and auditory.

* Objectives of this document

- Find a way to scale up SAN, using coconuts and bamboo canes as elements

- Decide on components.

- Design PCB for controller.

- Design PCB for IR transceiver.

- Create a manufacturing ready board layouts.

- Optimize price and manufacturing time.


* SAN desktop system

The SAN desktop system is fully functional, asides from a bunch of bugs.  Nodes
are 3D printed spheres with a diameter of 50 mm.  Edges have a length of 100 mm.
Nodes and edges are connected using BNC connectors.  Signals are transmitted via
wires to the network’s brain using a two layer protocol based on [[https://github.com/feklee/MultiTrans/][MultiTrans]].

* SAN life-size system

The SAN life-size system is under development.  It is not functional.  Only part
of it has been prototyped.  Nodes are coconuts of about 150 mm diameter, and
edges are bamboo canes of 500 mm in length.  Nodes identify themselves to their
neighbors using IR traveling through the bamboo canes.  Nodes send information
to the brain wirelessly.  No complex protocol is required.

* Brain

The brain is the central computer that visualizes the network and that allows
controlling how nodes in the network generate and modulate sound.

** Requirements for controller:

- Transmit ID and port numbers to neighboring nodes via IR transceivers.

- Receive IDs and port numbers from neighboring nodes via IR transceivers.

- Send information who neighbors who to brain, e.g. via WiFi.

- Low priority: Transmit audio and camera stream to brain.

- Low priority: Receive audio stream from brain and output it.

Camera, speaker, and microphone: low priority

Possible CPUs:

- Raspberry Pi 0 (lots of power, full Linux, can program the MCU directly,
  author knows it)

- ESP-EYE (cheap, with cam and mic on board, but limited power, MCU may need to
  be programmed separately)

Possible MCUs:

- STM32 Black Pill

- Arduino Pro Mini 328p (sufficient, used in SAN desktop system)

- /something that has an accelerometer already on board/

** Power bank

Example product:

- Product page: [[https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Single-usb-mini-2600mAh-battery-charger_60406994470.html][Single usb mini 2600mAh battery charger portable cell phone
  power bank]]

- Dimensions (cylindrical): 91 × 21.8 mm

- Weight: 90 g

The power bank could be positioned on top of a foam pad and fixed with cable
ties.  Like that it’s easy to replace.

[[./images/power-bank.svg]]

Alternatively, the power bank could be positioned loosely, with padding stuffed
around it, filling the entire coconut.
