#+TITLE: SAN: AI Based Visual Self Awareness

* Abstract

Two or maybe four cameras are put into each node.  The cameras see the
environment and in particular the connections to other nodes.  Camera
information is sent to the main computer e.g. via WiFi.

The network configuration plus camera images is used as training data
for machine learning.  Thereby the algorithm learns to infer the
network configuration from the camera images.

It is no longer needed for the nodes to communicate.
