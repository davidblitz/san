#+TITLE: SAN: Location Optimizer

#+BEGIN_abstract

The /location optimizer/ takes all the data that is available and
tries to find the coordinates of the nodes in space.

Input:

- which node is connected to which node and on which port,

- tilt angle of nodes (optional).

Output:

- coordinates of nodes in space,

- tilt angle of spheres for display (optional).

The location optimizer does its calculations under the assumptions
that:

- the distance of a connection is 1,

- the angle between connections is the tetrahedral angle (≈ 109.5°).

Properties of a node:

- A node may also be called a /sphere/, referring to the look of the
  physical implementation.

- There is one special node, the root node:

  + It connects the computer to the network.

  + It has one USB port that connects to the computer.

  + It has only one port: 1

  + It’s ID is: ~^~

- Non-root nodes have four ports: 1, 2, 3, and 4

- Each non-root node has a unique ID: A–Z

- A node’s /axis/ is relevant if there is information about its tilt
  angle. The tilt angle is measured by an accelerometer. As of this
  writing there is only one sphere that contains an accelerometer.
