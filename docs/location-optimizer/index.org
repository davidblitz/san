#+TITLE: SAN: Location Optimizer

* Abstract

The /location optimizer/ takes all the data that is available and
tries to find the coordinates of the nodes in space.

Input:

- which node is connected to which node and on which port

- tilt angle of nodes (optional)

Output:

- coordinates of nodes in space

- tilt angle of spheres for display (optional)

The location optimizer does its calculations under the assumptions
that:

- the distance of a connection is 1,

- the angle between connections is the tetrahedral angle (109.5Â°).


* Math

Here I'll try typesetting math, taking an example from the org-mode
manual:

\begin{equation}                        % arbitrary environments,
x=\sqrt{b}                              % even tables, figures
\end{equation}                          % etc

If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].
