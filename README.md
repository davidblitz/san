Introduction
============

SAN (Self Aware Network) is an experiment about the [future of
architecture][1]. The network understands its own topology. To get
started:

 1. Build nodes, edges, and the root node.

 2. Program the root node and the nodes.

 3. Connect the root node to the computer.

 4. Run the web app.

There may be [apps][5] built on top of the system.
