Introduction
============

Self aware network structure. It understands its own topology. Get started by
building the construction and running the software.

To get started: Build nodes and edges, program the nodes, then fire up
the web app.

Construction
============

Edges
-----

Edges are composed of RG58 cables inside metal tubes, connected to BNC
connectors.


Software
========

Setup of nodes
--------------

 1. Write ID and color on EEPROM of each MCU: `eepromWriter`

    The root node needs to have as ID: `*`

 2. Build and upload Arduino sketch to MCU: `node`


Building the webapp
-------------------

First enter the directory `webapp`, then:

 1. Install packages:

        $ yarn install

 2. Run tests:

        $ yarn test

 3. Build frontend:

        $ ./node_modules/.bin/rollup --config

      * On Windows call `rollup.cmd` instead of `rollup`.

      * Append `--watch` for automatic rebuilds during development.


Running the webapp
------------------

 1. Get help:

        $ yarn start

 2. Run the app, applying options as described in help.

 3. Connect to the web server with a browser.


Coding conventions
------------------

  * Maximum line length: 80 characters

  * Comments in Markdown

  * JavaScript passes JSLint.
